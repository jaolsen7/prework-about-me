      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I recently switched my career from high school science teacher to software engineer, because I realized that I can still make a difference and have a better quality of life. I have always been the "tech savvy" family member, as my Mom says, and I have some experience with Python from my undergrad years at UC Berkeley, so I am confident in this life decision. I am excited for all the new possibilities!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Central Coast, California (Arroyo Grande, SLO County)</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Hiking, gardening, yoga, going to the beach, dancing, watching movies/shows, and walking my dog :)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is one that betters the lives of others, eventually allows me to afford a home and raise a family, gets accomplished by working with teams and by myself, can be done online/remotely, and makes everyone feel valued and respected.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>San Diego, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because it opens up a lot more doors for me. I mean this in terms of improving quality of life as well as creating new possibilities of what I will be doing at my job. Software engineering has more creative potential, such as working on a website that provides a pathway to mental health services or an app that helps diabetic patients take their blood sugar. I could even start my own company one day!</p>
